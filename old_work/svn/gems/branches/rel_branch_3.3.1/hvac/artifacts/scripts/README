1) Need to have System Setup as follows (EM <- HVAC Server <- Bacnet Gateway <- 3rd Part BMS), Individual systems polling respective server in hierarchy for occ data
2) The main server for analysis is the HVAC server which has all the sensors, zones,  sensor zone mapping information and the sensor_history data over period of time
3) Objective to find out the occupancy pattern from the HVAC server over period of time

Utils:
hvac_analysis.sh, parsefiles.awk, processOccStats.sh
1) Extract occupancy data for 5 min interval for each zone in a CSV format (usage: bash hvac_analysis.sh [-st <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>])
This will give you the data from start Date till current date for each zone

2) Run the processOccStats.sh (this is dependent on parsefiles.awk)
usage: awk -F"," -v zone="ZoneName" -v startDay="YYYY-MM-DD" -v endDay="YYYY-MM-DD" -v startTime="HH:MM:00" -v endTime="HH:MM:00" -f parsefiles.awk Zone.csv

3) Finally you can run the above command for each zone file and get the required stats
