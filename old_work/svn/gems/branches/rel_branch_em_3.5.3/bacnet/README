It needs to be complied either for Lighting or for HVAC, but will compile 64 or 32 bit with no change.

To compile for HVAC
               make clean
               make HVAC

To compile for Lighting
               make clean
               make Lighting

Don’t forget the “make clean” when switching modes.

They will produce
               stack-0.8.0/demo/gateway/bacnetHVAC
               stack-0.8.0/demo/gateway/bacnetLighting
executables respectively. (These used to be called ‘bacnetd’)
