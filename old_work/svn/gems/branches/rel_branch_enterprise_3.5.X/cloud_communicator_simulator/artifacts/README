Setting up new simulator
======================================
1. Create simulator/xyz folder
2. Copy artifacts/config.prop to this folder. Update config.prop.
3. Make sure database with dbName as in config.prop exists on replica.
4. Check access to master and replica domains
5. Check if you can remotely access database on replica server. Eg: psql -U postgres -h replica_ip
6. Comma separated sensor macs can be obtained by executing "SELECT string_agg(d.mac_address, ',') FROM device d, fixture f where d.id = f.id and f.state like 'COMMISSIONED';" on replica db
7. On the simulator server, ensure you have /var/lib/tomcat6/Enlighted/certs/CA/enlighted.ts
8. On the simulator server, ensure you have one valid  /var/lib/tomcat6/Enlighted/certs/*.pfx.
9. Copy artifacts/connection_config.properties to /var/lib/tomcat6/Enlighted/
10. Copy artifacts/check_em_access.sh, artifacts/last_communication_time.sh and artifacts/config.properties to /opt/enLighted/communicator/. All files under /opt/enLighted/ should have user ownership. chown -R enlighted:enlighted /opt/enLighted/
11. Make sure that postgres is running on simulator server with port 5432. If it is some different port, update spring-context.xml dataSource.
12. Turn off tunnel and ssh tunnels on ecloud master. Run "update em_instance set open_tunnel_to_cloud = false, browse_enabled_from_cloud = false, tunnel_port = 0, open_ssh_tunnel_to_cloud = false, ssh_tunnel_port = 0;"
13. Restore artifacts/ems.dump on simulator as ems database. 'pg_restore -U postgres -d ems -v < ems.dump"
14. Make postgres setting changes so that 'psql -U postgres -d ems -h localhost' works.
15. Create logs folder under simulator/xyz
16. Copy artifacts/killall.sh to simulator folder. This script can kill all java -jar processes.
17. Copy artificats/simprocmon.sh to simulator folder. Update this script to run communicator simulations for various EMs.
18. Copy cloudcommunicatorsimulator.jar to simulator folder.
